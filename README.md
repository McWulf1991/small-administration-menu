# small-administration-menu
Here I created some kind of adminmenu, with just basic stuff, for Athena Framework by @Stuyk.

Some instructions:

LSHIFT + F11 triggers NoClip-Mode, also revert it.
CTRL + F11 opens the Menu, here you can navigate with arrowkeys and enterbutton.
ALT + F11 triggers some inputfield, where you can enter a vehiclemodelname. It spawns a Sessionvehicle.

I would like to mention, some options need some testing (car-teleports, especially player-teleports).
Code is mostly written in german, but i could provide an english version too.

Here some basic features of the menu:

NoClip and SessionVehicle bindings.
Event-Mode -> Change Skin, Teleport at coordinates with rangeinput, start atmospheric particles, reset skin
IMPORTANT NOTICE: Some skins will let you die instantly, prepare to revive yourself.
Getter-Mode -> (not finished yet) teleport to a car or a player in the lobby or get them to your position.

Some To-Do's on my list:
-Implementing administrative work for factions (create, delete, invite, kick, set money, and so on)
-Managing options for other players (implement ranksystem [ADMIN,SUPPORTER,MODERATOR], set bank, set money, spawn player car, and so on)
-Bugs (yeah I at least try to avoid some :D)

Feel free to report issues to impove my skills, I am still learning ;)
